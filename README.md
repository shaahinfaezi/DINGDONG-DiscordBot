# DINGDONG-DiscordBot
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe Bot for discord,That I made for my discord server : https://discord.gg/P2BrjMN 

Currently I can't run this Bot on a server,So if you want to use it follow these steps:

#1 : Make a Discord Bot here : https://discord.com/developers/applications 
For more info check this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2iaRVf4sho&t

#2 : Invite the bot to your server and add these roles to the server roles 
{
"Player1",
"Player2",
"TicTacToe":People will need this role to play the game,note that u can change this in the code.
"Owner":The server Owner AKA YOU.
And also these for the ranks:
"TTT BRONZE",
"TTT SILVER",
"TTT GOLD",
"TTT DIAMOND",
"TTT MASTER"
}

#3 :Run the bot for the first time and then go to the bot folder and go through this path "\DINGDONG-DiscordBot\DING DONG\bin\Debug\Resources" and in the config.json file you will need to set the token of the bot which you can find in https://discord.com/developers/applications, the command prefix , your Bot's ID which u can also find in the developer page,the ID of the channel that the bot will respond and your server's ID.(Summary:Run the bot and copy paste the strings)

* When you did all of that you're ready to launch the bot , you can launch it through the C# Solution or make a shortcut of the app which you can find on the bin folder : \DINGDONG-DiscordBot\DING DONG\bin

The bot commands :

 1.  In order to start the game you have to choose your player with these commands: ".player1" & ".player2"

 2.  Now you can play by choosing the number you want with this command:  ".ttt [number between 1 and 9]"

 3. You can also check your wins with this command(Leaderboards will be added) : ".tttstats"

**FEEL FREE TO CHANGE THE BOT HOWEVER YOU WANT AND PLZ STAR THE BOT**
