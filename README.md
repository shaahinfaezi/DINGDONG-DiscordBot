# :x: Tic-Tac-Toe :o: in Discord!!!


### This is a Tic-Tac-Toe Bot for discord That I made for [my discord server](https://discord.gg/P2BrjMN).

## Installing and Running the bot


#1 : Make a Discord Bot here : https://discord.com/developers/applications 

For more info check this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2iaRVf4sho&t

#2 : Invite the bot to your server and add these roles to the server roles 

{

`Player1`

`Player2`

`TicTacToe`:People will need this role to play the game,note that u can change this in the code.

`Owner`:The server Owner AKA YOU.

And also these for the ranks:

`TTT BRONZE`

`TTT SILVER`

`TTT GOLD`

`TTT DIAMOND`

`TTT MASTER`

}

#3 :Run the `Ding Dong.sln` file for the first time with [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) , you will run into some connection errors but don't worry just go to the bot folder and go through this path "\DINGDONG-DiscordBot-master\DING DONG\bin\Debug\Resources" and in the config.json file you will need to edit the file and set the token of the bot which you can find in [Discord Developers Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications), the command prefix , your Bot's ID which u can also find in the developer page,the ID of the channel that the bot will respond and your server's ID.

(Summary of #3 :Run the bot and set the configs)

* **When you did all of that you're ready to launch the bot , you can launch it through the C# Solution or make a shortcut of the app which you can find on the Debug folder : "\DINGDONG-DiscordBot-master\DING DONG\bin\Debug"**
