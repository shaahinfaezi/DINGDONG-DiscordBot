### This is a Tic-Tac-Toe Bot for discord That I made for [my discord server](https://discord.gg/P2BrjMN) using [Discord.net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net).

## Installing and Running the bot


**#1** : Make a Discord Bot here : https://discord.com/developers/applications 

For more info check this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2iaRVf4sho&t

**#2** : Invite the bot to your server and add these roles to the server roles 

{

`Player1`

`Player2`

And also these for the ranks:

`TTT BRONZE`

`TTT SILVER`

`TTT GOLD`

`TTT DIAMOND`

`TTT MASTER`

}

**#3** :  Open the bot's folder and go through this path "\Discord-DingDong-master\DING DONG\bin\Debug\Resources" then edit or open the config.json file and set the following:

* Token : Bot's Token which you can find in [Discord Developers Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

* Cmd Prefix : Command prefix for the bot(The default prefix is ".").

* Client ID : Bot's ID which you can also find in [Discord Developers Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

* Server ID (OPTIONAL) : The ID of your server which you can get by right-clicking the server name on top left of discord and selecting "Copy ID" be sure that you have developer mode ON this is how to do that [Developer Mode Tutorial](https://discordia.me/en/developer-mode#:~:text=Enabling%20Developer%20Mode%20is%20easy,the%20toggle%20to%20enable%20it).(It's optional,If you want to get a "UP and running" message in your server everytime you launch the bot,use it!)

**When you did all of that you're ready to launch the bot you can do that from the Ding Dong.exe app which you can find in the Debug folder : "\Discord-DingDong-master\DING DONG\bin\Debug"**
